              Founded by the illustrious House of Kumars, Verma Institute of
              Management Studies (VIMS) is a testament to a legacy of excellence
              in hospitality, helmed by our visionary president, Mr. Rajender
              Kumar Verma. With over four decades of dedication to the family’s
              distinguished hospitality ventures, Mr. Verma has been a key
              figure in shaping the culinary and hospitality landscape of
              Uttarakhand. His leadership in managing Kumar Foods Restaurant for
              over 30 years has earned it the status of an iconic establishment
              in the region. In 2021, furthering his vision of excellence, Mr.
              Verma expanded the family’s footprint with the launch of Hotel
              Alaya, a boutique hotel in the heart of Dehradun, offering a
              refined blend of luxury and local charm.
